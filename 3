Questions:
    1. What is pw_gecos?
    2. Where does Mac OS keep its users besides /etc/passwd?
    3. How does PAM read /etc/shadow if your program isn't setuid root?
Answers:
    1. May contain info such as name, office, office phone, and home phone. Can be changed with chfn(1)
    2. OSX has a daemon, opendirectoryd(8), that stores this info. It can be queried with dscl(1)
    3. pam_unix.so forks and execs unix_checkpwd, a setuid(2) root binary.
